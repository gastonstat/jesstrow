    "text": "These questions stayed with me through college at UC Berkeley, while earning my BS in Molecular Environmental Biology, where I learned to describe what I had seen growing up in a developing country. It became clear to me that one’s surroundings can have long-term consequences on health and disparities were also apparent in the communities where I lived in the United States---disproportionate rates of asthma, cancer, and other illnesses among minority and low SES populations. I made a commitment to help prevent environmental health burdens among women and minority communities that I carried with me through diverse career and educational experiences."
